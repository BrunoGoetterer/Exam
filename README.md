# StRiNgMoDiFy
This API that modifies a string, so that every other letter is a
capital latter. E.g., hello â†’hElLo. The API should also remember the length of the last
modified word (since the application was (re)started, no need to use a database).

# Project Description:
This application works using a REST-based server which uses the Spring Boot version 3.1.0
